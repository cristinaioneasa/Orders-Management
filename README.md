# Orders-Management
Implementation of an application for processing orders of a shop.

### About 
The objective of the project was to design a program in Java that would simulate orders from a store. This program was supposed to contain 3 tables: one with the store's customers, another with products and one with all the orders made. This program has a connection to a MySQL database that it operates with.
We can add, delete or change the details of an order or its product, entering the new data in the GUI interface. Also, when an order is placed, the stock of the products in the stores is updated automatically.

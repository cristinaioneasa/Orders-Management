# Orders-Management
Implementation of an application for processing orders of a shop.

### About 
The objective of the project was to design a program in Java that would simulate orders from a store. This program was supposed to contain 3 tables: one with the store's customers, another with products and one with all the orders made. This program has a connection to a MySQL database.
We can add, delete or change the details of an order or products, entering the new data in the GUI interface. Also when an order is placed the stock of the products in the stores is updated.

In Client table you can add, update or delete clients. The same for the Product table.

We can place an order choosing the Id of the customer who makes the order, the Id of the desired product and the number products.

Also when we add a new order, an invoice is generated automatically.
